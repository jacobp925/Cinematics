# Cinematics

## ðŸ“ƒ About

**Version:** `1.19.4`

> Allows users to create cinematics and chain them together to create cutscenes, intros, tutorials, etc. Unlike other
cinematic plugins, this one supports interpolated spline curves, which means you can add multiple points and have
smooth, non-linear movement between them.

> I originally developed an implementation of this in late 2021. Since then, others have copied it and sold the plugin,
> so I decided to come back and add some extra features for fun.

> I do not plan to regularly update this or provide any extra support.

**Note:** *You may use this on your servers; however, you may not reuse or resell any of the code.*
